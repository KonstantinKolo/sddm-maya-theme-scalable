# sddm-maya-theme-scalable
 
maya-scalable is a fork of the original theme that comes by default in the sddm package. 
 
### USAGE
 - once you installed the sddm package you should have a folder in /usr/share/sddm/themes
 - head there and git copy this file
 - after that you need to copy default.conf file in /usr/lib/sddm/sddm.conf.d in /etc/ and name it sddm.conf
 - edit the sddm.conf file  and under the [Theme] tag set "Current=sddm-maya-theme-scalable" (or whatever you named the git copy directory)
 - To change the scale or colors edit the theme.conf located in the git copy directory

### NOTES
 - I've changed the original color palette for a more aggressive style
